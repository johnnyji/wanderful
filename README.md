# Wanderful
Share and discover the web

### App created by: [Johnny Ji](https://www.johnnyji.com/)

**[Wanderful](http://wanderfully.herokuapp.com/)** is a place for you to tailor the web to your needs! Here's how it works:

0. [Make a profile](https://wanderfully.herokuapp.com/) (duh)
1. Save and share interesting links you find online
2. Collect (follow) other people to be updated on links they share
3. Gain Collectors (followers) by sharing more and more interesting links!


###The Dev Process:

I started this project with the objective of teaching myself Ruby on Rails. Prior to beginning this project, I have no experience with Ruby on Rails and throughout the process I've had the chance to learn some interesting things such as:

- The MVC Framework
- Relational Databases (PostgreSQL and SQLite3)
- Using Ruby Gems (ie. [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), [Twitter-Text](https://github.com/twitter/twitter-text-rb) etc...)
- UX Driven Development
- [Screen Scraping](https://github.com/jaimeiniesta/metainspector)
- AJAX
- SASS with Rails
- jQuery with Rails
- [HAML](https://github.com/haml/haml) (brief introduction)

This has been an amazing experience and I've only begun my journey into the Ruby language. I've got many more exciting apps on the way so stay tuned and in the mean time [check out my site](http://www.johnnyji.com/).
